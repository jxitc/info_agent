# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## AI Coding rules

- Keep it very concise, don't propose over complicated solutions
- Do not add any speculative features, we don't need it for now

## Project Overview

See ./requirements.md for more detail about this running project

## Development Commands

Since this appears to be an early-stage project without established build tools, development commands will need to be established as the implementation progresses. Update this section once package management and build systems are in place.

## Key Implementation Notes

- The system uses AI agents for dynamic field creation and information extraction
- Hybrid search combining semantic (RAG) and structured field-based queries
- Version management preserves memory history during updates
- Security and privacy features planned for M2 and later milestones


## Implementating Tasks
- When completed, remember to mark task as completed in @tasks.md, e.g. `[x]`
